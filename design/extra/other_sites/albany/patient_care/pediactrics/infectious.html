<p><img alt="kid" class="" src="infectious_files/CH_GeneralUse2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="270" hspace="2" width="181">Welcome</p></b>
<p>The Section of Infectious Disease comprises three physicians who are
all Subspecialty Board Certified in Pediatric Infectious Disease by the
American Board of Pediatrics. They are the only pediatric infectious
disease specialists in the twenty-two counties of northeast New York. </p>
<p>The scope of their clinical activities involves inpatient consultations for children with serious infectious problems including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meningitis 
</li><li>Pneumonia 
</li><li>Infections of bones and joints, blood, and skin. 
</li><li>They also evaluate children with cancer and those who have had
transplants (two groups of children at high risk for infection with
bacteria and viruses). </li></ul>
<p>Some infections are contagious for the community. The infectious
disease specialists work closely with community physicians,
epidemiologists, as well as community health agencies for infection
control. Through the public relations department, they are a called
upon as experts by&nbsp;the media to comment on issues relating to
influenza, meningitis, Lyme disease, and other infections of children,
and&nbsp;receive on average&nbsp;ten calls per day from community
physicians for phone consultations. Some children require a more
comprehensive evaluation and are seen in the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Clinic.</p>
<p>The Material Child Coordinated Care Program is a Center of
Excellence under New York State AIDS Institute. The pediatric HIV/AIDS
program is funded in part by a grant from the NYS AIDS Institute and
receives funding from both the NYS and federal governments. This
funding provides not only for the medical needs of the child, but also
for the social, psychological and educational needs as well. A Child
Life Specialist, Child Psychiatrist, Neurologist and case manager are
on staff to help the patient and their family with these issues.
Seventy-five pediatric AIDS patients are served by the Section of
Infectious Diseases in addition to the screening of approximately
thirty infants per year.</p>
<p>The Section conducts clinical research as a principal investigator
for vaccine and passive antibiotics drug trials. Dr. Aracelis Dulce
Fernandez is conducting basic science research assessing vaccine
responses in the Albany Medical College Center for Immunology and
Microbial Disease.</p>
<p>The Section also participates in the Albany Medical Center's mission
of education by teaching pediatric and medicine/pediatric residents as
part of their overall training, as well as third and fourth year
medical students. Additionally, the staff speaks for many local groups
on a variety of topics, including HIV/AIDS and Lyme Disease. For more
information about any of the above topics, please contact (518)
262-5332.</p>
