			<h1>Treatment Methods and Special Services</h1>
		 
		

<p><strong>Teletherapy </strong>(therapy from a distance) generally
refers to treatment delivered with a linear accelerator. Conformal (3D)
radiotherapy and IMRT are examples of teletherapy. </p>
<p><strong>Brachytherapy </strong>(close-up therapy) refers to
treatment delivered with the use of radioactive sources or seeds, which
may be inserted into a natural body cavity or implanted into soft
tissue. High dose-rate temporary implants and permanent prostate
implants are examples of brachytherapy.</p>
<p><strong>Conformal Radiation Therapy<br></strong>Conformal (3D)
treatment planning frequently allows more accurate definition of the
volume to be treated and the anatomy of critical normal structures that
should be protected. If your doctor recommends 3D radiotherapy for you,
you will need to have a CAT scan in conjunction with your simulation.
The CAT scan images (and sometimes MRI images, as well) are
electronically transferred to our treatment planning computers, where
your doctor will work with dosimetrists and physicists to delineate all
of the important structures (tumor and normal tissues) in each slice of
the CAT scan. This information is used to determine the safest, most
effective combination of radiation beams for your treatment. </p>
<p><strong>Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)<br></strong>Intensity
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a specialized form of 3D
radiotherapy that allows radiation to be more exactly shaped to fit
your tumor. With IMRT, the radiation beam can be broken up into many
beamlets, and the intensity of each beamlet can be adjusted
individually. Using IMRT, it may be possible to further limit the exact
amount of radiation that is received by normal tissues that are near
the tumor. In some situations, this may also allow a higher dose of
radiation to be delivered to the tumor, increasing the chance of a
cure. <br>The key to making IMRT most effective is being able to
localize the target volume prior to each treatment. Conventional
radiation therapy techniques make use of skin marks and bone positions
from x-rays. However, internal structures such as the prostate can
change their position daily with respect to the skin and bones by 1 cm
or more. For that reason, the treatment team in radiation oncology will
sometimes insert tiny gold markers (fiducial markers) into the target
region of the body (such as the prostate or breast) to help precisely
locate the target for daily treatments. These markers are imaged daily
prior to treatment.&nbsp; The accompanying software tells the
therapists how to adjust patient positioning to&nbsp;match the
treatment plan. </p>
<p><strong>Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)<br></strong>Normal
structures and tumor position can&nbsp;change from day to day due to
differences in organ filling, weight&nbsp;changes&nbsp;or simply from
breathing. IGRT is conformal radiation treatment guided by imaging
equipment such as CT or stereoscopic X-rays, that is mounted&nbsp;on
robotic arms on the linear accelerator. These images are&nbsp;taken
daily before the patient is given the radiation treatment. </p>
<p>All IGRT patients first undergo a CT scan as part of the planning
process. The digital information from the CT scan is then transmitted
to the console in the treatment room to allow doctors to compare the
earlier image with the images taken just before treatment. Within
seconds, computer calculations determine the movements necessary to
match the planned treatment fields to within a millimeter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This allows doctors to better target the cancer while avoiding
nearby healthy tissue. In some cases, fiducial markers (as described
above) are implanted in or near the tumor to help localize it during
IGRT. </p>
<p><strong>Respiratory Gating<br></strong>This treatment capability
allows the physician to compensate for tumor motion due to
respirations.&nbsp; Normal tissue can be spared as the radiation beam
is on only when the tumor falls within the planned treatment volume.</p>
<p><strong>Stereotactic Radiosurgery<br></strong>Stereotactic
radiotherapy is a technique that allows your radiation oncologist to
precisely focus small beams of radiation to destroy certain types of
tumors. Since the beam is so precise, your radiation oncologist may be
able to spare more normal tissue than with conventional external beam
therapy. This additional precision is achieved through rigid
immobilization, such as with a head frame as is used in the treatment
of brain tumors. Although often performed in a single treatment,
stereotactic radiotherapy can also be delivered in multiple treatments,
called fractionated radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiotherapy may be the
only treatment if a very small area is affected. In addition to
treating cancers, it can also be used to treat malformations in the
brains blood vessels and certain noncancerous (benign) brain tumors.</p>
<p><strong>Endorectal Radiotherapy</strong><br>Some small, superficial
cancers of the rectum can be treated with a specialized type of
external beam radiotherapy called endorectal radiotherapy. A metal tube
is inserted into the rectum, and the beam is directed down the tube
onto the inside surface of the rectum. Low grade, superficial rectal
cancers may respond well to this treatment, sometimes allowing the
patient to avoid major surgery and colostomy. </p>
<p>High dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy is very important in the
treatment of vaginal, cervical and uterine cancers, and it can be
incorporated into the overall treatment plan for many other tumors
(sarcoma, head and neck tumors, prostate tumors) as well. HDR
brachytherapy is given over the course of several minutes, using
equipment that allows the tumor to be temporarily exposed to a very
active radioactive seed. In the case of gynecologic cancers, a vaginal
cylinder or ring and tandem apparatus may be used to deliver the
treatment. If solid tissues need to be implanted, needles or catheters
may be used for the treatment. You will usually be able to go home
immediately after this treatment. Depending of the type of cancer you
have, you may need to have several sessions of brachytherapy to cure
your cancer.</p>
