			<h1>What Can Patients Expect?</h1>
		 
		

<p><strong>Welcome to Radiation Oncology<br></strong><br>Our staff
is&nbsp;prepared to deliver a treatment program that meets your unique
needs.&nbsp; We are equipped with the latest technology, and we have
highly skilled specialists&nbsp;ready to serve on your treatment
team.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are commited to making&nbsp;your treatment as
effective and comfortable&nbsp;as possible.</p>
<p>The following&nbsp;information is provided to give you a better
understanding of what to expect during your course of treatment.&nbsp;
Please read through this information and contact us with any questions
you may have.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Program<br></strong>Your radiation oncologist
determines how many days/weeks you need to be treated with
radiation.&nbsp; The doctor bases the length of your treatment course
on several factors and may lengthen or shorten your course at any
time.&nbsp; The course could range in length from ten to forty
treatments (or two to eight weeks).&nbsp; </p>
<p>The treatments are given on Monday through Friday.&nbsp; We treat
only emergency cases on Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; You should use these
two weekend days to rest.&nbsp; The radiation may cause you to be more
tired than usual and you need to try to keep your strength up as much
as you can.&nbsp; You will see your doctor and a nurse weekly to check
your status.&nbsp; However, you may request to see them at any time. </p><p><strong>Treatment Team<br></strong>During the course of your
treatment you will meet a number of health care professionals who make
up your treatment team.&nbsp; Members of the department include: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Radiation Oncologist</strong> - a medical doctor specialized in using radiation to treat disease. 
</li><li><strong>Radiation Oncology Nurse</strong> - provides nursing care and education about treatment as well as the management of possible side effects you may experience. 
</li><li><strong>Radiation Therapist</strong> - licensed professional that positions you for your treatments and operates the equipment that delivers the radiation. 
</li><li><strong>Dosimetrist</strong> - performs the calculations and computer planning for your treatment. 
</li><li><strong>Radiation Physicist</strong> - performs routine review
of treatment plans and quality control of the department machines to
assure the radiation dose received by the patient is accurate and safe.
</li><li><strong>Receptionist/Secretarial Staff </strong>- obtain
needed medical information for treatment, schedule necessary
appointments and assist in answering any questions you may have.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Treatment&nbsp;Machines</strong><br>Simulator and Planning Systems<br>There
is one simulator and three treatment planning computer systems in our
department.&nbsp; The simulator is a specially designed diagnostic
x-ray unit.&nbsp; It is used exclusively for designing your treatment
fields.&nbsp; The high speed computer planning system allows the
physics and dosimetry staff to perform dose calculations for the
treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Linear Accelerators</strong><br>The linear accelerators are
the treatment machines that will be used to deliver the radiation,
according to the treatment plan developed from the information obtained
during the simulation process.&nbsp; The simulator and linear
accelerators are quite large and can be intimidating at first, but they
are safe and reliable.&nbsp; At no time will you actually feel the
radiation given for your treatment; it can be compared to a regular
diagnostic x-ray.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Simulation Process<br></strong>To develop the most
effective treatment plan for you, we need to define the location of
your tumor site and what structures need to be included in the
treatment area.&nbsp; This treatment planning session is called
simulation.&nbsp; It takes about one hour to accomplish and will be
scheduled after you meet with your Radiation Oncologist.&nbsp; Some
more complex treatment simulations may require more than one hour, or
more than one simulation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>During both the simulation and subsequent treatment sessions it
is important that you remain still.&nbsp; The table you will be lying
on will be hard and flat, but we will make you as comfortable as your
treatment planning will allow.&nbsp; Tape, straps, or special
immobilization devices are sometimes used to help you maintain the
treatment position.&nbsp; </p>
<p>During simulation the Radiation Therapist, under the direction of
your doctor, takes x-rays and measurements and marks the treatment area
on your skin.&nbsp; These skin marks will aid in reproducing your exact
positioning each day for treatment and will be placed using a special
pen or liquid skin dye.&nbsp; Sometimes a Dosimetrist may come in
during the simulation to take additional measurements for a computer
treatment plan.&nbsp; Photographs will be taken for identification and
positioning purposes.</p>
<p>In some situations the doctor may request that contrast be
used.&nbsp; Contrast allows us to see certain parts of your body that
would not normally be seen on an x-ray.&nbsp; This could involve
drinking a liquid contrast agent, receiving an injection, or having a
small tube placed in your rectum.</p>
<p>A contour (outline or shape) may be taken of the part of your body
that will be treated.&nbsp; This is usually done using plaster
strips.&nbsp; They will be placed on you warm and wet.&nbsp; The
plaster will dry and conform to your shape in about 10 minutes.&nbsp;
Once it has dried, the plaster will be removed. This will be used along
with other simulation information in planning your
treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When simulation is completed, the simulator therapist will give you
an appointment for your daily radiation treatments, which will usually
start within a few days after the simulation.</p>
<p><strong>Immobilization Devices<br></strong>An immobilization device
is something that we may use to help you stay perfectly still.&nbsp; We
may also place treatment field marks on the immobilization
device.&nbsp; If a device is needed it will be made during the
simulation before the films are taken.&nbsp; These are constructed
especially for each patient and will increase the amount of time for
simulation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;For specific simulations such as planning done in the head and
neck area, and sometimes the pelvic region, an aquaplast mold will be
constructed.&nbsp; Aquaplast is a plastic mesh sheet&nbsp; that becomes
flexible when heated in water.&nbsp; This allows the therapist to place
the sheet over the area of interest and form it as needed.&nbsp; It
will be warm and wet.&nbsp; As it cools it keeps the shape it was
molded to and will be used to reproduce your positioning for your daily
treatments.</p>
<p>Port Films<br></p>Port films are films taken with the actual
treatment machine.&nbsp; They are different from diagnostic x-rays and
are used only to see the anatomic position (bones primarily) and not to
assess tumor response.&nbsp; Port films will be taken the first day in
the treatment room.&nbsp; You will be lying on the treatment table in
the same position as you were in the simulator.&nbsp; Port films will
only confirm that the treatment area matches the area that was
simulated.&nbsp; It is not unusual to require additional port films
after the first day.&nbsp; The therapist will tell you if the film
needs to be taken again.&nbsp; You can assume if the film is not
repeated the next day, then your positioning does not need any
adjustments.&nbsp; Port films are taken every week to verify continued
accurate positioning. <p><strong>Daily Treatment<br></strong>It will take about 15 minutes
to receive your treatment each day.&nbsp; Most of that time will be
spent getting you in the exact treatment position.&nbsp; The actual
radiation will only be "ON" for about 30-45 seconds for each treatment
field.&nbsp; Depending on your treatment plan, you will receive from
one to as many as six treatment fields each day.&nbsp; You need to hold
very still for your treatment, but do not try to hold your
breath.&nbsp; Breathe as evenly and normally as possible.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The therapist will be outside the room during the time the radiation
is actually on.&nbsp; At all times, the therapists will be able to see
you on closed circuit television monitors and communicate with you by
intercom.&nbsp; In the event you may need a therapist during the actual
treatment delivery, call out or wave your arms.&nbsp; The therapist
will turn off the radiation and come in the room to assist you.</p>
<p>Your treatment may require multiple fields or a single field.&nbsp;
The therapist may enter the room between these fields, but please do
not move.&nbsp; Once you are positioned for your treatment do not move
until the therapist tells you the session is completed.&nbsp; You will
not feel anything during the treatments just as you would not during
regular x-rays.</p>
<p><strong>Cone Down/Boost<br></strong>After a certain number of
treatments, your doctor may order a "cone down" or "boost" of the area
being treated.&nbsp; This means that the original treatment area is
reduced in size to be able to continue delivering dose to the original
cancer site while protecting some surrounding tissues and
structures.&nbsp; The cone down or boost will often require another
simulation to create a revised treatment plan.&nbsp; This will be
scheduled in advance by your treatment therapist. </p>
<p><strong>Skin Marks</strong> <br>At the time of simulation, marks
will be placed on your skin to outline the area to be treated.&nbsp;
These marks need to stay on your skin throughout the course of
treatment and will be darkened as needed by the therapist.&nbsp; Please
be careful of these marks when showering.&nbsp; You should not use soap
or scrub this area.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you notice that your marks have faded, DO NOT attempt to darken
them on your own at home.&nbsp; If there is ever a question of the
accuracy of these marks, or if they have faded too much, you will need
to go back into the simulator and have the marks redrawn.&nbsp; If you
are concerned about your marks, please notify your therapist. </p>
<p><strong>A Note About Appointments<br></strong>It is very important
that you arrive for your treatment appointments on time.&nbsp; Every
patient is given a&nbsp;minimum15 minute time slot and has been
carefully fit into the structure of the daily schedule.&nbsp; If you
arrive early, it may not be possible to take you early.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We understand that your time is valuable and we work hard to keep to
the schedule, but there may be some instances when there are delays and
you will have to wait past your appointment time.&nbsp; If possible, we
will attempt to notify you in advance of any delays.&nbsp; If this
happens we apologize and appreciate your patience.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you run into a conflict with your daily appointment time, please
notify the therapists with as much advance notice as possible.&nbsp;
They will do their best to adjust your appointment for that day to
accommodate you. </p><p><strong>Parking</strong><br>Parking is available, at no cost,
for Radiation Oncology and Radiology patients in all visitor/patient
parking areas.&nbsp; Ask for a parking validation sticker at the
reception desk in the department.&nbsp; You will need to present the
attendant with this sticker along with your parking stub.&nbsp;
Unfortunately the designated parking lot out front is small and it
tends to fill up quickly.&nbsp; If this happens, the parking attendant
should direct you to the parking garage across the street or one of the
other parking lots.&nbsp; The validation stickers can be used for these
areas, also.<br><br><strong>Skin Care</strong><br>During your course of
treatment, you may notice some redness, itching, dryness or darkening
of your skin in the treatment area.&nbsp; These are normal reactions to
the radiation therapy.&nbsp; They may become more noticeable as
treatment continues, especially if you have had any chemotherapy.&nbsp;
<br>Below are some guidelines for the care of your skin while you are receiving radiation therapy: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DO</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wear soft, loose clothing over treatment area 
</li><li>Keep the skin in the treatment area clean, dry and open to air 
</li><li>If shaving the treatment area, use electric razor 
</li><li>Avoid injuring the skin or exposing it to the sun or wind 
</li><li>Use Aquaphor or Eucerin moisturizer only as directed 
</li><li>Use baking soda or cornstarch as directed 
</li><li>Inform your doctor or nurse if you have irritation or pain<br></li></ul>
<p><strong>DO NOT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Use any soap, cream, lotion, medication, deodorant powder unless directed 
</li><li>Use heating pads, hot water bottles or ice packs in the treatment area 
</li><li>Rub or massage the skin in the treatment area 
</li><li>Use tape of any kind on skin in the treatment area 
</li><li>Wash off or remove any marks on your skin 
</li><li>Replace, retrace or remark your skin</li></ul>
<p><strong>Bloodwork<br></strong>Your blood counts will be monitored
while on radiation treatment.&nbsp; In general samples are taken every
two to three weeks, depending on the type of radiation you are
receiving and if you are also having chemotherapy treatments.&nbsp;
Most blood work results are available in two days, and if they are not
normal, you will be informed.&nbsp; If you have questions, please ask
one of the nurses.<br><br><strong>Medications</strong><br>A complete
list of current medications is requested for review including over the
counter medications.&nbsp; Please inform your physician/staff of any
additional changes in medications during your treatment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A basic multivitamin, one without a high concentration of vitamins
or herbal supplements may be taken (i.e.: CVS brand, One-A-Day, or
"Basic" Centrum).&nbsp; We will be available to discuss what
medications may be resumed upon completion of treatment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><strong>Follow-up Visits</strong><br>Your
radiation oncologist may request that you return to this department for
follow-up visits.&nbsp; The routine follow-up visit schedule is 1 month
although this can vary for each patient.&nbsp; Your radiation
oncologist may suggest that you alternate some of your follow-up
appointments with your other oncology physicians.&nbsp; At the end of
your course of treatment you will be notified of the intended follow-up
plan.</p>
<p><strong>Billing/Statements<br></strong>Patients for radiation therapy services receive two (2) bills: </p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Physician services 
</li><li>&nbsp;Hospital or technical services</li></ol>
<p>Please note that there may be hospital and physician charges for
dates when you are not physically here in the Radiation Oncology
Department.&nbsp; A variety of activities may have occurred, such as
computerized treatment planning, 3-D digital reconstruction, and
shielding design and construction.&nbsp; These activities will be
billed for the actual day that they are performed.&nbsp; The staff will
be utilizing your chart, films and/or scans.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Questions?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please Ask.<br></strong><em>Speak with a nurse</em><br>To speak with a nurse call (518) 262-3368, Monday through Friday, 7:30 to 4:00 p.m.<br><br><em>Speak with your doctor<br></em>To
