NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES--FALL 2030

This Eastern Division road map is provided for quick reference to major
roads and Fortress Towns.  For detailed information about any city, check
the AADA's North American Road Atlas and Survival Guide, available at any
bookstore, truck stop, or AADA office.

ALBANY, NY
The capital of New York has strict duel-control ordinances, but local
duellists can always visit the Albany Motordrome for a sanctioned combat!
For those less than successful in these endeavors, repair and weapon
facilities are available.  Be sure to look for the Empire State Plaza
Pistol Duelling Grounds, one of Albany's most popular attractions.

ATLANTIC CITY, NJ
Most travellers visit Atlantic City for its famous casinos--or to play "live
Monopoly" along the boardwalk.  But some lucky duellists pass Go for a good
deal more than $200 at the Baltic Duel Arena...Atlantic City is also the
site of the original live "Shootout" game; tickets are available at the
Fitzsimmons Sports Office.
G, A, TS, C

BALTIMORE, MD
AADA members visiting this city should confine their travels to the
relatively safe downtown area.  The suburbs, hard hit in the Food Riots, are
unsafe for travel at any time, though individual vehicles in Division 20 or
above may visit them for combat practice.  Downtown, travellers will want to
see the luxurious Hotel Baltimore, a historic 200-year-old structure, and
the East's only fully-domed combat stadium, Irsay Memorial Arena.
WS, JB, AADA, TS, H

BOSTON, MA
Massachusett's state captial--once an historic site--was nearly levelled in
the Food Riots; it is now one of America's most modern cities.  Boston
boasts no ordinary weapon shop, but Uncle Albert's catalog showroom.  Full
cloning facilities are available at Boston Gold Cross.  There are three
local arenas; daily AADA events are held at the downtown Yelrow Arena, but
city championships move to the New Boston Duelling Arena because of its
larger capacity.  New car buyers can also check out the Fnord Motors
Assembly Plant.
TS, WS, A, S, JB, GC, AP, AADA, TS

BUFFALO, NY
Visitors of the city will want to check out the Buffalo Municipal Coliseum,
still under construction.  This project has been plagued by delays since its
inception, but (when finished) it will be one of the nation's largest.  Be
sure to visit the weapons ship for the latest in duellist accessories.
WS, S, AADA, TS

DOVER, DE
Dover is best known for the world-champion Dover Destroyers, scourge of the
combat football circuit.  Dover is also the capital of Delaware and the site
of the Delaware Agricultural Museum, where visitors can see living samples
of many nearly extince plants such as wheat, orange trees, and potatoes.
WS, S, TS

HARRISBURG, PA
Harrisburg is the capital of Pennsylvania.  The base of a strong militia
during the Second Civil War, it remains one of the more peaceful parts of
the state, although downtown areas may be unsafe after dark.  Duellist
facilities are fairly complete, with ample repair and salvage capacity and a
truck stop famed for hospitality to autoduellists.
G, A, S, TS

MANCHESTER, NH
State government moved here when Concord, the original capital, fell victim
to the Purple Flash in 2014.  Visitors to Manchester can tour the plant of
Origin Systems, manufactureres of fine targeting computers, combat
simulation software, and similar duelling gear.
G, A, AADA, TS, OSI

NEW YORK CITY, NY
The "Big Apple" hosts the AADA Divisional Championships every six months.
It's also the site of the Magnum Motors assembly plant.  Due to the danger
to Manhattan's fabled skyscrapers, all vehicle weapons must be covered or
unloaded downtown--Be careful, because the city militia enforces this rule
strictly.
G, WS, A, S, JB, GC, AP, AADA, TS

PHILADELPHIA, PA
The "City of Brotherly Love" has neither repair facilities nor a weapon shop
but is home to Panthera Pets, a shop where one may find rather unusual
animals.  Drivers planning trips through Philadelphia should budget their
resources carefully and check in the AADA office for the latest update on
road conditions.
JB, AADA, PS, TS

PITTSBURGH, PA
With the destruction of Detroit in WWIII, Pittsburgh became the center of
the new U.S. auto industry.  Most battlecar builders are still headquartered
here--call the individual plants for tour information.  Visiting duellists
may want to drop in on a meeting of the Allegheny Autoduel Association.
G, WS, A, S, JB, AP, AADA, TS

PROVIDENCE, RI
Rhode Island's state capital, Providence has no arena and no duellist
facilities whatsoever, aside from its downtown truck stop.  A major
Providence tourist attraction is "aquaduelling"--armed speedboat combat!
It'll never replace autoduelling, but it's certainly a thrilling sport.
TS

SCRANTON, PA
Once a thriving mining town, Scranton was all but destroyed when the quakes
of '18 toppled the city into the coal mines underneath.  Rebuilt to the
north of the original site, Scranton is now a small but solid Fortress Town.
The rubble of Scranton Crater, along with the scarred acreage left over from
a century of mining and blast-furnaces, has become the East's largest
private-war compound.  Corporations and special-interest groups come here to
settle their differences while the nation watches via live TV coverage.
WS, S, TS

SYRACUSE, NY
Syracuse hosts the famed New York State Fair and Combat Exposition from July
to September each year.  Visitors to Syracuse should pay close attention to
local road and warning signs; urban renewal is only now getting under way,
and abandoned buildings in the downtown area still shelter street gangs.
WS, TS

WASHINGTON, D.C.
Captial of the 47 states, Washington's chief industry has been government
for over 250 years.  The President of the United States still fires the
ceremonial "first shot" in Federal Arena each year to start the AADA
duelling season.  The city also has some of the finest garage and salvage
facilities to be found on the Atlantic coast.
G, A, S, TS

WATERTOWN, NY
Watertown, the East Coast's largest algae-production center, entered the
duelling circuit when the Woolworth Arena was constructed.  One of the
Eastern Division's newest and most modern facilities, the Woolworth seats
40,000.
