WEBFACTION NOTES:
   1.  MEDIA: 

	media is going to be located under either
		webapps/media_production
		webapps/media_development
	
	now I could have located it under webapps/media/production but the problem with that is that I'd end up giving potential jerks a chance to know that they are in the production or development server, something I don't want to do.
	
	The problem is that webfaction doesn't let me symlink direction to repository/production/media, which means I have to
	
	ln -s ~/repository/production/media/* ~/webapps/media_production
	
	Which has me symlinking to everything in the media directory.  But if I add on or get rid of a folder, file, whatever, UNTIL I SYMLINK AGAIN, THAT FILE WILL NOT DISPLAY IN MEDIA_PRODUCTION
	
	So keep in mind that you must always symlink when doing anything.  Might be a good idea to run a script of some sort for exactly this purpose

    2. APPS:

	ln -s ~/repository/development/apps ~/webapps/django_development/libs/apps

	Make sure to update the .wsgi configuration file to reflect this
	Also keep the path.webfaction.sh script updated as well
